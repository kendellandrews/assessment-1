//Write a conditional statement that checks if the password meets the following constraints:

// At least 10 characters long
// Contains at least one letter and one number
// If the password meets the constraint, console log a success message.

// If the password fails the constraint, console log a failure message.

// Test out your conditional by changing the value of your password variable and running your file!
